done
//addded next and previous page for tables on PageNav
//create select button stays as + sign and doesnt change pages.
//added alert to if required field is empty on create record pages, and required symbol, create Task looks ugly bc i like ugly
could be done better
//array of inputs and mapping over them is more complicated if there is many different types, better if all the same type and no conditionals
navigate-1 after create record save -- dont know why it wont work,. save = posts and sql gets it, but no response, stays pending response in network tab
//?? ( Over complicatedion? )reusable function typed 3 times into the 3 pages, put reusable function in one function then put that one function in the three files instead lol ?
